<flowchart_prompt>Generate a Mermaid flowchart for the full EAI Interpretable Interface workflow: Natural Language Goal → Goal Interpretation (InterPreT) → Formal Representation (LTL Formula) → Subgoal Decomposition → Hierarchical Subgoals → State Transition Modeling (LogicGuard) → Validated Transitions → Action Sequencing (AuDeRe) → Adaptive Planning (A* / BFS Selection) → Executable Action Sequence. Use English labels, rectangular nodes for stages, diamond nodes for decision points, and arrow connections with data flow annotations. Include module names and key tools used in each stage.</flowchart_prompt>

<flowchart_prompt>Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram for the Goal Interpretation module: Input (Natural Language Goal) → Preprocessing → InterPreT Library Integration → Formal Logic Conversion → Output (LTL Formula). Include component labels in English, show data transformation steps, and highlight the role of InterPreT in converting natural language to structured representations.</flowchart_prompt>

<flowchart_prompt>Generate a Mermaid flowchart for the Subgoal Decomposition module: Input (Formal Representation) → Task Complexity Analysis → Hierarchical Subgoal Generation → LTL Formula Assignment → Subgoal Validation → Output (Hierarchical Subgoals with Preconditions/Effects). Include English labels, show the decomposition hierarchy, and highlight the generation of interpretable subgoals with explicit preconditions and effects.</flowchart_prompt>

<flowchart_prompt>Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram for the State Transition Modeling module: Input (Hierarchical Subgoals) → Initial State Definition → Transition Rule Extraction → LogicGuard Integration → State Transition Validation → Output (Validated State Transitions). Include component labels in English, show the validation process for state changes, and highlight the role of LogicGuard in ensuring valid transitions.</flowchart_prompt>

<flowchart_prompt>Generate a Mermaid flowchart for the Action Sequencing module: Input (Validated Transitions) → Task Complexity Assessment → Planning Algorithm Selection (A* vs BFS) → Adaptive Plan Generation → Action Library Integration (BEHAVIOR) → Action Sequence Validation → Output (Executable Action Sequence). Include English labels, diamond nodes for decision points (algorithm selection), and highlight the adaptive planning capability based on task complexity.</flowchart_prompt>

<flowchart_prompt>Generate a Mermaid architecture diagram for the EAI Interpretable Interface system: Core Modules (Goal Interpretation, Subgoal Decomposition, Transition Modeling, Action Sequencing) with their respective tools (InterPreT, LogicGuard, AuDeRe) and data flow connections. Use English labels, rectangular nodes for modules and tools, and arrow connections showing data direction. Include a brief description of each module's functionality and key innovations (Adaptive Planning, Interpretable Subgoals, Robust Testing).</flowchart_prompt>
